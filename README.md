# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the theatre outcomes based on the launch date and the outcomes based on goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

When analyzing the data for the parent category Theatre, the most successful month was May  with a grand total of 166, of which 111 were successful, 52 had failed, and 3 were canceled. In contrast, December was the least successful month with a grand total of 75, of which 37 was successful, 35 had failed and 3 were canceled. Her grand overall total for all the months was 1369, which includes success failure and canceled.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

When analyzing the data for Outcomes Based on Goals, Louise most successful campaign occurred the goal range of 35000 to 39999 as she got about 80%, followed closely by successful campaigns which have goals less than 1000, which was 76%. The highest failed campaign occurred in 45000 to 49999. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I had performed my analyses by filtering out each category (successful, failed, and cancelled)and putting them in the pivot table with the appropriate filters. In terms of coding, the COUNTIFs function was a big tricky to get the funding goal amount. For example, in the coding, the dollar sign did not show up automatically, therefore I had to input the dollar sign myself when getting the percentage for each column. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The two conclusions that can be drawn is that there has been a higher successful rate for theatre outcomes as opposed to fail rate. Also, very few have been cancelled throughout the year with January having the highest cancel total of 7.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

One conclusion that can be made is that her campaign was successful as the  successful percentage for each goal majority stayed relatively higher as compared to failed percentage except during the goal range from 20000 to 34999 and 40000 to 50000 to more.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations can be that Loiuse may not have presented the data correctly.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other possible table or graphs we can create are a bar graph or a stacked bar graph to see the successful, failed, and cancelled for each month as per category.
